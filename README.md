## Contents
- `AMJAD_BioMed_TP.pdf` — Complete report including all three exercises:
  1. Identification of medical imaging modalities  
  2. Optical microscopy schematics  
  3. Analysis of a cell fluorescence timelapse (photobleaching phenomenon)

- `Images/` — All images used for analysis
- `Tasks.pages` — Original assignment questions

---

##Main Observations
- Different imaging modalities characterized by their signal type (X-ray, acoustic, magnetic, photon, etc.)
- Optical microscopy modes compared (phase contrast, confocal, bright-field, fluorescence)
- Quantitative fluorescence analysis showing **photobleaching** and **morphological changes** in a cell timelapse sequence
